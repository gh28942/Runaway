Run away from the fox. Last as long as you can! 

Controls: w,a,s,d to move and k to kick.

The highscore is stored in an AES encrypted file. You need to have its folder in the same location as the exe/jar file. 

There is an easter egg in it which will make christmas trees appear if you play the game around Christmas time.

EXE created from the executable jar file with Launch4j.
