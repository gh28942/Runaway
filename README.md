# Runaway
Java Minigame with a JavaFX User Interface. Music, sounds and some game mechanics are handled in different threads. Run away from the fox as long as possible! 

Controls: w,a,s,d to move and k to kick. 

The highscore is stored in an AES encrypted file. You need to have its folder in the same location as the exe/jar file. 

There is an easter egg which will make christmas trees appear if you play the game around Christmas time.

EXE created from the executable jar file with Launch4j.
